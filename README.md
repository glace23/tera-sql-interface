Update or Create an Interface for an Microsoft SQL Database
We need an interface to access ten years of minute climate data for growth chambers used in a global warming grassland experiment. The data are stored in a Microsoft SQL database. We already have an interface written in C++. This interface could be updated or you could use it as a template to build your own interface. This could be an individual or a group project.

# <h2> Objectives
The primary deliverable is to improve the accessibility of data from the database.

# <h2> Motivations
We will use this interface to access data to write chamber climate control or climate change impact papers. The potential exists for you to write first-authored or co-authored papers in either of these areas, depending on your interests.
